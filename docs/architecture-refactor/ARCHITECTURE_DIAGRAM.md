# MemoryLane Architecture Diagram

This diagram captures:

- **Current pipeline** (what runs today)
- **Target timeline-first pipeline** (based on your design direction)

## Current (Today)

    IM["Interaction Monitor<br/>(uiohook + app-watcher)"]
    AM["Activity Manager<br/>(window boundaries + capture triggers)"]
    REC["Recorder<br/>(desktopCapturer + visual detector)"]
    SF["Screenshot Files"]
  end

  subgraph Processing["Processing Layer"]
    PQ["Processing Queue"]
    AP["Activity Processor"]
    OCR["OCR"]
    CLS["Semantic Classifier (LLM)"]
    EMB["Embedding Service"]
    DB["Storage (SQLite + vec + FTS)"]

## Target (Timeline-First)

```mermaid

  subgraph Producers["Independent Producers"]
    SP["Screen Capturer<br/>(fixed interval, e.g. 1 fps)"]
    EP["Event Capturer<br/>(interaction + app/window events)"]
  end

  subgraph Streams["Durable Streams"]
    FS["Frame Stream"]
    ES["Event Stream"]
  end

  subgraph Activity["Activity Layer"]
    APROD["Activity Producer<br/>(sessionize + join frames/events + build activity payload)"]
    AOUT["Activity Stream"]
  end

  subgraph Extraction["LLM/OCR/Embedding Layer"]
    EXT["Activity Extraction<br/>(LLM summary + OCR + embeddings)"]
  end

  STORE["Storage"]

## Target Extraction Detail

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  AOUT["Activity Stream"]
  COORD["ActivityExtractorCoordinator"]
  TX["ActivityTransformer (Injected)"]
  SINK["ActivitySink (Injected)"]
  STORE["Storage"]
  AOUT --> COORD
  COORD --> TX
  TX --> SINK
  SINK --> STORE
```

### Component Responsibilities

- `ActivityExtractorCoordinator`: orchestrates extraction for each activity from the stream.
- `ActivityTransformer` (injected dependency): maps `V2Activity` to storage-ready extracted data.
- `ActivitySink` (injected dependency): persists extracted data to storage.
- In tests, inject fake transformer/sink implementations to validate coordinator behavior without real LLM/OCR.

## Why the target split helps

- Producers are simple and testable in isolation.
- Activity logic is centralized in one producer, which is easier to reason about.
- Activity extraction is downstream-only and independent of capture/sessionization internals.
- Regression tests can replay streams deterministically.
- Extraction can be tested without LLM calls by injecting transformer/sink dependencies.
