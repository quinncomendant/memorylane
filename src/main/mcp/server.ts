MemoryLane captures application sessions and stores one activity per session with \
an AI summary, OCR text, app metadata, and timestamp. Use it to recall past \
screen activity.

## How to reason about data (critical)

- **Use summaries for activity conclusions** — when answering "what the user did," \
ground conclusions in activity summaries from search_context or browse_timeline.
- **Use OCR for exact recall only** — use OCR only when the user needs exact strings \
(file names, error messages, copied text, specific wording).
- **Never infer activity from OCR alone** — OCR is ambiguous: it may include passive \
reading, user-authored text, third-party content, ads, or notifications.

## Choosing the right tool

- **browse_timeline** — open-ended questions like "what did I do today?", \
"summarize my morning", or "what was I working on last Friday?". Use higher \
limits since each result is a compact one-line summary suitable for activity \
reasoning. \
10-100 is a good default limit for searches over less than 30 minutes. \
100-500 is a good default limit for searches over many hours.
- **search_context** — targeted recall like "when did I review PR #142?", \
"find my work on the auth module", or "that error I saw in the terminal". \
Results are ranked by semantic relevance and return summary-first context, including app and window title.
- **get_activity_details** — fetch full activity details including OCR screen text \
for specific activity IDs returned by the other tools. Use this only when exact \
on-screen text is needed; do not use OCR as the primary source for inferring user activity.
- **list_patterns** — show all detected workflow patterns with sighting counts. \
Use for "what patterns have you found?", "show my habits", or pattern review prompts.
- **search_patterns** — find patterns matching a keyword. Use when the user asks \
about patterns involving a specific app or workflow.
- **get_pattern_details** — drill into a specific pattern to see its evidence and \
sightings. Use after list_patterns or search_patterns.

## Typical workflows

1. Activity question: browse_timeline or search_context → answer from summaries.
2. Exact-text question: search_context/browse_timeline → get_activity_details on key IDs → quote OCR text.
3. Drill-down: start broad with browse_timeline, then refine with search_context.
4. Mixed question: use summaries for narrative and OCR only for precise supporting details.
5. Automate patterns: list_patterns → get_pattern_details → write .claude/skills/ for each automatable pattern.

## Tips

- Combine time filters with semantic queries in search_context to narrow results.
- Use the appName filter when the user mentions a specific app ("in VS Code", "on Slack").
- When summarizing a time period, prefer uniform sampling to cover the full range.
- If summary and OCR seem to disagree, trust summary for "what happened" and treat OCR as raw evidence only.
- Activity IDs are opaque UUIDs — never fabricate them; always use IDs from tool results.`
