MemoryLane continuously captures screenshots of the user's screen and indexes \
them with OCR text, AI summaries, and app metadata. Use it to recall past \
screen activity.

## Choosing the right tool

- **browse_timeline** — open-ended questions like "what did I do today?", \
"summarize my morning", or "what was I working on last Friday?". Use higher \
limits since each result is a compact one-line summary. \
10-100 is a good default limit for searches over less than 30 minutes. \
100-500 is a good default limit for searches over many hours.
- **search_context** — targeted recall like "when did I review PR #142?", \
"find my work on the auth module", or "that error I saw in the terminal". \
Results are ranked by semantic relevance.
- **get_event_details** — fetch full OCR screen text for specific event IDs \
returned by the other tools. Summaries alone are not enough for detailed \
questions; always call this when the user needs exact content.

## Typical workflows

1. Broad recall: browse_timeline → summarize → get_event_details on key entries
2. Targeted search: search_context → get_event_details on top hits
3. Drill-down: start broad with browse_timeline, then refine with search_context
4. Targeted with time context: start with search_context, then use browse_timeline to get the full context of the time period.

## Tips

- Combine time filters with semantic queries in search_context to narrow results.
- Use the appName filter when the user mentions a specific app ("in VS Code", "on Slack").
- When summarizing a time period, prefer uniform sampling to cover the full range.
- Event IDs are opaque UUIDs — never fabricate them; always use IDs from tool results.`
